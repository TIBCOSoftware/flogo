# Labs

After getting up and running you might want to try your hand at some more advanced labs and tutorials. These labs provide you with a guides, tutorials and code samples and will help you work through building and deploying Flogo apps. The labs cover a wide range of topics like deploying to Kubernetes, using Flogo with the Serverless Framework and a bunch more! The colors of the cards have a meaning:

* The "_yellow_" cards emphasize building apps using the Flogo Web UI
* The "_red_" cards use external tools like Kubernetes or the Serverless Framework
* The "_blue_" cards have an emphasis on using the Flogo CLI
