# The Internet of Things

The Internet of Things is a magnificent place and with Flogo you can make it even better. To get started we've created a write-up of how to deploy your Flogo apps to some of the most common devices we could find.

  {{< bigcard img="../images/labs/034-experiment.svg" headercolor="bg2" text="Flogo can run almost anywhere. From the largest clouds, to the smallest of devices and everything in between. Take this lab to get yourself familiar with how to develop apps for IoT devices using the Flogo CLI." href="../labs/iot-howto">}}
