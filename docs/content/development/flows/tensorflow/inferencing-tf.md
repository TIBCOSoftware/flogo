Before you begin with the [ML Inferencing activity](https://github.com/TIBCOSoftware/flogo-contrib/tree/master/activity/inference), refer to the [Flows > TensorFlow > Getting Started](../../flows/tensorflow/getting-started/) documentation.

## Overview of the Inferencing Activity

The Inferencing activity was built to support the concept of plugable frameworks, however the only supported framework is currently TensorFlow. The activity leverages the Golang API from TensorFlow. You don't need Python or anything other than the TensorFlow dynamic library installed on your target machine.
