In order to contribute to the Flogo documentation, please follow the instructions below.

* Fork the flogo repo
* Add your markdown documents to the /docs/docs folder. To follow our standards, name your document using hypens to seperate words.
* Edit _data/docs.yml and add your new document. The `id` attribute should match the name of the markdown file (minus the .md extension). The title should be descriptive, but not too long.
* Rebase your repo
* Create a PR against the primary flogo repo
