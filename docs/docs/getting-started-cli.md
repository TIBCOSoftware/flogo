* flogo: This CLI provides app/flow dev support. You can use this to create your applications, build applications, install new extensions, etc. This can also be used in conjunction with your CI/CD pipeline.
* flogogen: A scafolding CLI used by extensions (activity/trigger) developers to build new extensions.
