# Project Flogo

Project Flogo is an Open Source Framework for IoT Edge Apps & Integration. 


Highlights include:
* Ultra-light process engine - 20x-50x lighter than Java or NodeRed
* Extensible & reusable by design to build your own apps, frameworks & platforms 
* 100% Open Source 

Project Flogo consists of the following sub-projects available as separate repos:
* [flogo-cli](https://github.com/TIBCOSoftware/flogo-cli): A command line tool to build flogo apps 
* [flogo-lib](https://github.com/TIBCOSoftware/flogo-lib): A library to build Flogo extensions
* [flogo-services](https://github.com/TIBCOSoftware/flogo-services): Backing services required by Flogo 
* [flogo-contrib](https://github.com/TIBCOSoftware/flogo-contrib) : Flogo Extensions available out of the box

## Getting Started

Project Flogo was designed from the ground up leveraging modern technology and architectural principals to better suit the IoT, edge and microservices app developers. The current set of tooling is designed for:

- IoT Solutions developers
- Cloud-native microservices developers
- Serverless function developers
- Flogo Extensions developers 

In addition, tooling to address the needs of the zero-code application developer is available via Flogo Web UI. Project Flogo and the tooling continue to evolve quickly, we recommend that you check out the videos and sign up for updates on the project to stay current.
